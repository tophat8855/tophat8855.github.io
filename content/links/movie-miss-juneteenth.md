This is a new 2020 film that was an official selection at both Sundance and SXSW, about a single mother
who used to be a beauty queen and now has a daughter who is participating in the same pageant she had
before having her. I watched it because someone at work mentioned that Mayvenn was thanked in the credits
and it was very sweet and well-made. The characters are real, the movie is simply well-done.

I've linked to the Kanopy page for watching it since it is free through many libraries, including my local
Oakland Library.
