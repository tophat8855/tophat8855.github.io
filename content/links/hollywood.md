I watched this at the recommendation of a friend from high shcool. I started watching it when
my husband was out of town and when I finished the first episode, I knew I'd have to stop because
he would want to watch it with me. I even woke up the next day after watching the first episode
thinking, "I really want to keep watching. Do I really have to wait?" I did wait and I really liked it.
The ending was a little too shiny, but the last episode IS called "A Hollywood Ending" so it
fulfilled the expectations.
