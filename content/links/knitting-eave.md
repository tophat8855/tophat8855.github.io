This pattern is by [Kira K Designs](http://www.kirakdesigns.com/) and I've knit another skirt pattern of hers in the past. I've decided that for
the duration of the [Pigskin Party](http://www.downcellarstudio.com/pigskin20/), I'm going to randomly choose my knitting projects from my Ravelry queue and 
this one had been in the queue for a while, but I didn't have the yarn. So I bought some and now I have a lovely skirt.

I chose orange because orange looks good on me and blue because it is a good contract color (and also the Pantone Color
of the Year for 2020). Stylish.
