Another family movie night flick. This one was really good. The same studio made Into the Spiderverse and you can tell
they are testing the bounds of computer animation in this new one just as much as the Spiderverse. I told my husband
that it's like Pixar isn't even trying anymore and now Sony Animation is giving them a run for their money and being the
creative leaders in the animation space.
