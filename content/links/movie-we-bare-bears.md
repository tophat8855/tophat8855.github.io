I had seen a little video with the We Bare Bears many years ago and didn't know it beacme a TV show
and now a movie. They definitely bring the issues of immigration and separating families at borders 
into this story, but with a children's animated comedy, so I don't think kids'll pick up on it. It 
was fine. We rented it from Google or Apple, I'm not sure.
