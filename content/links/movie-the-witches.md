I had seen parts of this movie as a kid and didn't get very far in- the part with the girl 
in the painting was too spooky for me. I decided I'm grown-up enough that I should be able to
handle this now. And I am. The puppetry and effects are SO GOOD and I read that 
this was Jim Henson's last movie. I'm curious if it'd be as spooky to my kids, since what
scares kids has probably changed over time.
