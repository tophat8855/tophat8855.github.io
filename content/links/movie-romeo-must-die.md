Lots of wonderful things in this action movie: Jet Li and Aaliyah (may she rest in peace), for starters.

Jet Li escaping a Chinese prison by bike. It takes place in Oakland (though the opening sequence is all
San Francisco landmarks). 

Also A+ for the biracial (Asian/Black) main characters and central romance.
