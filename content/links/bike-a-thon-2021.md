I'm riding in the Cycles of Change Bike-a-thon in June. I'll be doing laps around Lake Merritt for an hour and you can
donate a sum, to support [Cycles of Change](https://cyclesofchange.org/). Cycles of Change provides bikes and bike 
education to East Oakland youth.

The Bike-a-thon will be live-streamed, too. So feel free to [watch](https://givebutter.com/bikeathon) on June 18.
