I knew about prison, hospital, and military chaplains and have friends who have been prison and hospital chaplains,
but I learned that Tyson Foods employs 200 chaplains for their meat facilities, and that there are Nascar Chaplains.
I also learned more about the Chaplain of the United States Senate (and apparently, House of Representatives). I
think that attending to people's spiritual and emotional needs, non-denominationally, is a vital part of humanity
that gets overlooked.

I've linked to the Kanopy page for watching it since it is free through many libraries, including my local
Oakland Library.
