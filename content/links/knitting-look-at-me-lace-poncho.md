This pattern is by [Candace Eisner Strick](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/candace-eisner-strick) but is not available on Ravelry.
I have the printed pattern from a free table at a knitting retreat. The yarn is [Fibernymph Dye Works](https://www.fibernymphdyeworks.com)
BFL Mountain Tweed.

I chose orange because orange looks good on me, but I was nervous because this orange is more rusty than bright and I wanted a bright color.
So all while I knit it, I was nervous and didn't enjoy the process as much as I'd like. However, it looks great on me and so I love the product.
Worth it. It's too chilly to wear something so airy right now, but it'll get lots of use next fall.
