This is one of those movies where I used a random number generator to pick the movie and so I watched it. It's a
British comedy horror film from 1990. That'll tell you enough about the level of humor and scariness there is. It's
all very highly contrived, but does keep to the vampire tropes of anti-sunlight, anti-garlic, wooden stakes, crucifixes,
and drinking blood. So there's that.

Bonus surprise: Anthony Daniels (C3PO) is the priest.
