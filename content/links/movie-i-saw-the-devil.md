After watching The Awakening, I expected this South Korean horror film
to delve into mysticism as well, but it was just a straight-forward slasher
film. And if this film were accurate, South Korea would be teeming with 
serial killers. This movie is not accurate, and Korea isn't full of serial
killers, but that's what you'll get here.
