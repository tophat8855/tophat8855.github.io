I expected this to be mainly about the camp, but it is really mostly about how Section 504 and the ADA came to be.
This is very important history and too recent- we should have had these changes much sooner, and there is so much
to do yet for disability rights. It should have won the Oscar over My Octopus Teacher, absolutely. Should be required
watching for teens when learning about civil rights- disabilty rights are just not taught about in school. And anyone
at any time can become disabled. So important for everyone.
