This was from the Knitcrate box in February; I like to work the pattern that comes with the yarn because I'm
really into randomness and I like doing things I didn't have to plan myself. These took 2 weeks to make- one
week for each sleeve. I had to use smaller needles so I went up to the XL size. They are a gift for someone
and from the pictures I have of her, I think they'll fit. I have beefy biceps so if it fits me, it's probably
good.

Not sure what to do with the leftovers. Maybe baby booties.
