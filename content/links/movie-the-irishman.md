We decided to watch The Irishman because my husband went to a SIGGRAPH session about the aging/de-aging graphics techniques.
We had to watch it in 2 nights because it is rather long  (perhaps too long?). It took me until the end to realize
that the narrator was speaking to the author of the book that the movie is based on. One thing to point out in the de-aging
was that the artists involved in that were de-aging the character, not the actor, so early photos/movies by De Niro and
Pachino and others are not going to match the younger versions of the characters they portray. It's worth it to see this
movie, despite its length.
