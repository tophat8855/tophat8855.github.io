We started watching this years ago and have been watching through the DVDs we get from Netflix.
We have finally finished! I really came to love the characters and story. Definitely not a story that
could have been told much earlier than when it came out- it would not have worked so close to the Cold
War, but it's so good. I love Russell's and Rhys' performances and the dedication to the era and setting.

Regarding the ending, I think everyone ended up doing what I expected, except for Paige. I didn't mind her
ditching her parents on the train; Russia wasn't home for her, but you don't go back to the scene of the crime,
especially since she had done some espionage herself. The more thought-out action would be to take the new
identity she was given and go some place else for 5 years and work or go to school, and then contact her 
brother when it was "safer." But back to the house right away? No.

Definitely not a show for the squeamish. But the story and arc are very good if you put the time in.
Recommended.
