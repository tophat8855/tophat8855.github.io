The story of this octopus is a sad one. I was not interested in Foster's story or why he ended up
filming in a South African kelp forest. White man tears. But the octopus- I really liked her.
Foster forms this friendship, but when the octopus is in need in a shark attack where she loses
an arm, he doesn't do anything. I just think that if this octopus is as advanced as a dog or cat,
she probably felt a little bit betrayed that her human friend just stood by. I get that he wanted to 
"leave nature alone" but he wasn't doing that to start with. Introducing an observer absolutely changes the environment.

But did I get teary when she died and meditate on my own mortality? Yes, I did.
