The Bicycle Film Festival is virtual this year and we bought the tickets for the San Francisco screening time. We loved it- a wonderful
mix of the previous years' films and new ones. Some from the 2012 Olympics, and one from the BLM protests of 2020. I loved the first
animation one. Very cute. Highly recommend watching it. My kids really got into it and one now wants to try BMX.
