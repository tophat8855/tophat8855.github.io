I hadn't seen this classic horror film until this year. My mother said she saw it as a teenager and that it gave her 
nightmares for weeks, which seems funny now in 2020, when the special effects look much more campy and low-budget
than current movies. It was also obviously made in the 60s with how they treat women: absolutley like objects. One
character even mentions how hard it will be to fight back the ghouls with just the "3 of us" completely not counting
the 2 women present. Of course, one of the women is in shock and completely useless. 

But it was a lot of fun to watch. A few plot holes (that dead person upstairs never came to life? the mother just waited
for her daughter to kill her- she couldn't stand up and overpower an undead child?), but it was fun. And the ending- well,
unfortunately, ACAB. The last 5 minutes was definitely the worst part of the movie, graphic-wise, for me.
