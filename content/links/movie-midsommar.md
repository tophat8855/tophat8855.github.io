Oh wow, Midsommar. I really loved it. The mood, the setting, especially. You can tell there was
obviously a lot of thought put into the paintings and costumes and sets. It's long, but you don't
ever want to stop watching. I mean, there are parts that are very graphic and you might want to look
away, but also, you get wrapped up in the ethereal mood.

I'm sure the reason for all this nonsense is that no one is getting good sleep when it's only dark 
for 3 hours at night in the middle of the summer. Not a good combination for thinking clearly. 

It did have me wondering where the sheep were. It doesn't stay summer all year and they need some wool
to stay warm the other half of the year. Where is there knitting? I'm sure it's as gorgeous as their
woodworking and painting and embroidery. I'm totally down for a Midvinter sequel.
