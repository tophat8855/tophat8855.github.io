I made a set of 3 Among Us Crewmates. The other two are [cyan](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/TopHat/knitted-among-us-crewmate-6) 
and [brown](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/TopHat/knitted-among-us-crewmate-5).

I used both the [written pattern instructions](https://www.smiklegoesknitting.com/post/among-us-crewmate-free-knitting-pattern) 
by Charlotte Smikle as well as her [youtube instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3IjTu5ZTSc&t=11s). I found that the youtube
video was more accurate for the body, but the written pattern was fine for the backpack and face. I didn't do a black outline
for the visor, but they are still very cute. Smikle saw my remarks about the video/written instructions and she updated the
written instructions with better counts, so hopefully it all works for you.
