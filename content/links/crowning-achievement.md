I took this headdress workshop from the Chicago Academy of Burlesque. Eva La Feva is a friend from high school
and I've made multiple headdresses for costuming and thought it'd be nice to take a class from a friend and improve
my knowledge in case I need to make another headress. 

I would normally share my notes, but I know that the CAB plans on making the class available as a video, so I will
share that when that's available, or share how to purchase it. I think about the headress I made for my sister-in-law's
wedding and I really could have used some of her suggestions.
