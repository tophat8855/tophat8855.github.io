With the combination of Black History month and our love of bicycles, we decided to watch this PBS 
documentary from 1999 about the 25th Infantry's bike ride from Montana to Missouri. The army wanted
to see if troops on bicycles would be a good replacement for troops with horses. Bicycles don't need
feeding and are quieter and don't kick up dust and give away your position like horses do. This regiment
was an all black group and the documentary talks about the racism they experienced and what happened to
them after they left the army.
