I bought this yarn from [Gate City Yarns](http://www.gatecityyarns.com/) when I was visiting my grandfather two Thanksgivings ago. I loved the
contrast of the barberpole black and pink. I had only one skein and so I decided to make a hat. The Bedhead Beanie
pattern is featured on the cover of [Knitscene, Winter 2019](https://www.interweave.com/product/knitscene-winter-2019-digital-edition/)
and I acquired it through RB Digital through my local library. The cables step up as the hat closes. I have slightly
less than half the yarn left over and I'm thinking of making the smaller version, but I don't know if I'll have enough yarn.
I think I'll have to use some black for the brim to make up for it.
