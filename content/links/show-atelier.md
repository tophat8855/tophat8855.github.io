The American title of this show is "Atelier" but the Japanese title is "Underwear". It's a very
sweet dramedy series that I watched while donating platelets for the past few months. One season
long, it is a complete story of itself. I enjoyed the acting and also the politeness but also frank
honesty of the Japanese people they captured here. I found that a lot happened each 50 minute episode- 
I would often forget what had happened at the beginning of the episode until it was referenced back and
would think, "Was that _this_ episode? It seems so long ago!"
