These were definitely made to be watched together, so here they are. Lots of plot holes, if you give
it a think. Do they really think leaving Jennifer in the future would work? Also, if going forward to the
future and then back splits timelines so much, how come future Biff's travel back and forward didn't 
split the timeline? Also, typical Hollywood portrayal of Native Americans, so that's not cool.

But the kids found it very fun.
