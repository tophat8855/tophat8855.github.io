I made two of these with my knit crate box skeins, one for me and one for my sister. The Ravelry link
for my sister's is [here](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/TopHat/cabled-hat-2).

Each hat was a full skein. Instead of a 4" brim on each I just knit until I ran out of yarn. The cabled cast-off
looks great, but is such a pain to do.
