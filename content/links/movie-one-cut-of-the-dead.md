I added this movie to my to-watch list at the behest of a coworker. 
I got the DVD from Netflix (why yes, I still pay for the the Netflix DVD subscription).
I didn't know what I was going into before watching it except that it's a zombie movie
being filmed when real zombies show up during the filming. That's all you need to know.
Do not watch the trailer before this movie. If you like zombie comedies, you should 
add this to your list.
