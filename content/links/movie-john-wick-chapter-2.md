When I finished the first John Wick, I commented that it ought to be called "John Wick: Dog Person."
Unfortunately, this installment has fewer dogs, but the choreography is pretty great and I enjoyed
the soundtrack. I even borrowed the soundtrack from Hoopla so I could pretend I'm in an action movie
when I bike around. Overall, though, the first was better.
