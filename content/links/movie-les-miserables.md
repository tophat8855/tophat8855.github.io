I usually try to finish the book before I see the movie, but alas, I am only half way through the book (review coming).
It is tempting to critique the movie based on what they left out of the book (which is a lot), but I should leave the
book stuff for that review. As always with movies that were once books, you know bette the motivation of the characters
when you read the book and so much background is explained. The movie/musical skips a lot, because it must, but it skips
rather important character motivations and it didn't need to do that. All of the actors have great emotion and the close 
ups and single-cut shots make it intimate, but it also makes the student revolution feel small, which is a loss.
