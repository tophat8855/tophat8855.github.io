This pattern is by Verena Cohrs in [Sustainablist's](https://www.sustainablist.co/) TRAVEL. I received TRAVEL as a gift.

I wanted to use up the [Karaoke yarn](https://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/south-west-trading-company-karaoke) and I 
thought I'd get a sweater for myself out of it, but after knitting a third of the yarn,
I realized I wouldn't have enough so I frogged everything and knit it to fit my kids. It came out well, but this yarn is not good
for frogging or the invisible ribbed bind off method. It just turns to wisps
