I have a hard time getting into movies with Johnny Depp because his alleged abuse against his partner(s?). But I like
Alan Rickman. The songs weren't as catchy as I was expecting, but maybe I'd need to see it a couple of times.
I was surprised that they did leave the "good" characters alive at the end instead of killing at least the little boy
off. If you want a dark musical, here's one.
