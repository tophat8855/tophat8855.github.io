I didn't start this show until this year, which was probably a failing. It's really good and they push
the boundaries of animation, have great visual gags, and lots of alliteration and puns. It is both a serious
look at depression and addiction, as well as witty and humorous. There are whole episodes that are just an attempt
to try something new and I think it's great that Netflix allowed the creators so much freedom. Good character 
develoment and growth, too.
