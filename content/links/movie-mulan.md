We finally watched the 2020 live action version of Mulan. It was pretty good and the kids liked it. I liked how they brought
in the musical themes from the cartoon version. Probably could have used some singing and a fun dragon side kick. I think
the phoenix was supposed to represent that, but it got gimmicky, especially at the end giving her "wings". I thought the
relationship between Mulan and Xianniang was really great and I liked the mentor role she took.
