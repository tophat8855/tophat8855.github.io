We've been watching Schitt's Creek and at the end of the fifth season, the town puts on a performance of
Cabaret. Because musicals were discouraged in our house growing up, I missed any exposure to this musical
so I figured I should see the film before watching the Schitt's Creek episode.

This was really good. Lisa Minelli carries the whole show and the complex issues of bisexuality in a world
where Naziism is rising are played well.
