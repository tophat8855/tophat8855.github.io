Watching "I Had an Abortion" on [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/video/i-had-abortion). 
It's distributed by [Women Make Movies](https://www.wmm.com/). It chronologically highlights the experiences of women who
had abortions in the 1930s up until the move was created in 2005. This includes famous Gloria Steinem, 
but also, at the 34:20 mark, a woman named Jenny Egan, who grew up Mormon. Some women already had children,
some would later have children, and some never had any. With 1/4 women in the United States having an abortion
at some point in her life, it's important to listen to these stories and keep abortion safe and legal.
