I was first intrigued about this movie from listening to
[MovieBS's podcast episode review](http://www.moviebs.com/2018/05/07/episode-404-tully-overboard-bad-samaritan/).
It was "BS Approved" and so I kept it on my radar. So when a coworker re-recommended it to me, I was ready
to sit down and watch. 

It's a great portrayal of the early postpartum period and if you probably should not watch it if you are currently
at that stage of life because it may be too real. But I think this movie about postpartum depression, and then mania,
is a really important story to tell.
