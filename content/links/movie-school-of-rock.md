Now here's a classic I never got around to watching as a teen! I'm glad I got to watch it with my kids, though.
Jack Black does everything right here and the kids are outstanding (some even went on to become professional musicians).
Wonderful messages about drive, learning, and body confidence. Definitely recommend. Remind yourself what learning
is really about, especially in this virtual schooling pandemic time.
