This was our family movie night movie and I hadn't seen it before. I like the DC stories and
wish the movies were better in general. This one was one of the better ones, but dispite the
PG-13 rating, was mostly geared towards kids. And my kids loved it and it was fun. Would be 
interested in sequels about the family of Shazam super heroes.
