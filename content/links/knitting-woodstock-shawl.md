For my birthday, I was given a [KnitCrate subscription](https://www.knitcrate.com/) and the first box came with
this sparkly gray yarn and instructions for making a shawl. I wanted to make sure I finished it before I got 
the next box and I achieved that! The instructions were straightforword, and I ended up with more yarn at the
end than I anticipated. I really like the tassels. I think I need more tassels in my life. Why not accent everything?
