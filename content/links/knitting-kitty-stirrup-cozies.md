I made these by commission for a friend. I made the cat chart. I'm unsure about the placement of the cat face
and I may rip these out to fix that. Or make new ones. I also need to determine how much I'll charge.

I tried to use fuzzy white yarn for the cat faces, but it wasn't possible to see the cat pattern with that.
