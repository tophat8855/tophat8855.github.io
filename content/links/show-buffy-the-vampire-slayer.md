I did not watch this as it came out- I was a little young when it started and busy with my life by the time I was a teen.
I started watching Buffy from the beginning 8 years ago when it was on Netflix, but then it was moved off and we watched
it on Facebook Watch and then to Hulu, which we just recently got. A lot has happened in those 8 years and the whole last
season was colored by Charisma Carpenter's startements of how terrible Whedon is. Veronica Mars. We watched Angel 
concurrently with Buffy so that we could watch where the crossovers happen. I absolutely believe Carpenter and I wish
there was something I could enjoy without knowing that slimy people were behind it. I wish Gellar had more gumption about
making statements like Carpenter does, but I also understand if she wants a break from that mess. It's easy to get typecast.
As with everyone else, "Once More With Feeling," was a lot of fun. I think if you want to watch a show that takes place in SoCal
with a blonde, early college-aged woman tackling issues like sexual assault in the early 2000s, you'll do better to watch
