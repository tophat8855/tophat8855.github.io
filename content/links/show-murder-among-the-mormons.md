Having been Mormon and interested in Mormon history, the Hoffman forgeries and bombings were not
unknown to me and I new the basic story. This fleshes out what I knew, but leaves out some key aspects:
that one of the keys aspects of putting Hoffman on the suspect list was the differing story he told about
how he was blown up in the car vs. the story that forensics found (that he wasn't fully sitting in the car,
otherwise how would he have been blown across the street). It doesn't go into why we was there messing with
the bomb in his car, either.

But very importantly, it completely skips the women involved, particularly Kathy Sheets. Because she wasn't
a targeted victim, the documentary doesn't go into her story or the people she left behind. Leave it to men-
tangentially-related-to-Mormonism to leave women out of their documentary. I'd also be interested in what has
happened to Hoffman's wife in the years since. They interviewed her, but mostly on the past. She's still around
so maybe that was left out for privacy reasons.
