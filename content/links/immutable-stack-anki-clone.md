This playlist is a screencast of creating an Anki clone wth Clojure, ClojureScript, and Datomic.

I watched the first 5 videos today (only ones available as of right now) because, while I work in Clojure, I haven't
worked with Datomic and I was curious about it. This screencast isn't for beginners- it assumes you have a basic
understanding of Clojure and Clojure project set up, though the creator does write comments so you can follow along.
If you are following it like a tutorial, you'll have to pause it often because it is pretty speedy.

I'll probably watch the rest when the come out because I'm curious how they'll use the ClojureScript. I know there's
a lot of ways to do the same thing, so watching other people work is very educational.
