I walked through Aphyr's Clojure from the Ground Up chapter on polymorphism today while following along in my repl
and it was really good to see the how defmulti/defmethod, definterface, defrecord work similarly and differently.

If you are looking for a good post about Clojure and polymorphism, this is probably the best.

I would like to do the problem set at the bottom of the chapter tomorrow.
