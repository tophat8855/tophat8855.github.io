It took me more than 2 months to make this sweater. It's oversized so that it will be warm and cozy.
I finished it on a particularly warm day this spring, but it's supposed to get chilly again and I'm glad
I have a new sweater in the rotation. There are 3 big mistakes in it, but I'm sure no one else can tell.
