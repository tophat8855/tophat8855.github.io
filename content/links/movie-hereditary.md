This one is a good slow burn. I expected more creepiness early on, but it does get there. I think a second watch
would indicate more spookiness early on- a lot is subtle and I bet knowing the ending makes the beginning scarier.
Not for the faint of heart (gruesome death, spooky suspense, etc), but only one big jump scare. I think I'll have to
watch it a second time.
