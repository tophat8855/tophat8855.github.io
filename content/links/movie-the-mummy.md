It had been a while since I had seen the 1999 The Mummy with Brendan Fraser so it was a good option for
showing the kids. It was a bit too scary for the youngest, but it's a fun romp. Everyone in the cast is
beautiful and on point. The graphics seem a little silly now, but it's still properly creepy/freaky/scary.
