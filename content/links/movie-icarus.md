I don't know why I started watching this- I think because it started related to biking, though
I'm not really into road bike racing. And then it turned into quite the affair! Fogel really hit
the jackpot by starting to work with Rodchenkov just before all the Russian drugging scandal happened.
It was really interesting. I didn't pay much attention to the Russian doping scandal when it happened,
but since the Olympics are this summer again, it's good to catch up on it.
