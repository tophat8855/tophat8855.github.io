I guess this is my year for watching horror movies made in 2018. We went into this one not knowing
it was a horror comedy and being surprised with the comedy aspects. There are essentially 2 movies in 
this one. The first follows one woman who buys the red dress and ends up dying and the second is of a 
man who wears the dress on a dare. I guess it all comes together in the end. Definitely for a mature 
audience. Don't take it too seriously.
