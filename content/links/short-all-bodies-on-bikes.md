This short came out a couple of months ago, but since I'm revisiting stuff for National Bike Month, I thought I'd share it here.

Very important stuff about weight and fatness and perception about what different bodies are capable of and are allowed to do. This
is definitely more of a beginning of a conversation and not an end. Maybe Shimano will make more? I'm not sure if they will. I went
ahead and followed Kailey and Marley on social media anyway. Bikes are not just for thin or straight-sized people.
