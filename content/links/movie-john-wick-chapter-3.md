This installment of the John Wick: Dog Person chronicles included more dogs! Hooray!

I didn't find the soundtrack to be as captivating as [Chapter 2's](/links/movie-john-wick-chapter-2/), so this loses points there. 
They are always getting more creative with the action scenes: a fight in a library, a chase on a horse. 
And that's fun. Mix it up.

I am absolutely ready for another installment of John Wick: Dog Person.
