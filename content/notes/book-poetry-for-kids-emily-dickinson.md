Read this aloud to my kids, one poem a day. I'm glad it had a couple of her classics and ones I remembered from 
my mom's Dickinson book from when I was a kid. The illustrations were lovely, too. Good for elementary and middle
school. A high schooler might enjoy it too, but as it's more of a picture book, it may turn them off.
