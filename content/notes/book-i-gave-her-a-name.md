I think I prefer the shorter book, Mother's Milk, by Steenblik. This had some lovely poems in it, though.
Maybe it suffers from the lack of novelty that the first book had? I liked it. I didn't get the version with
the color images, so I can't say anything about that. Absolutely would gift this book.
