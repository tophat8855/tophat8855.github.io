I really enjoyed this collection of short stories. In other feminist sci-fi short story compilations 
by Microcosm Publishing, you get a few inexperienced writers and the writing suffers from that, 
but this collection is full of professional writers, which made it really enjoyable to read. Definitely 
recommend for the bicycle science fiction readers out there.
