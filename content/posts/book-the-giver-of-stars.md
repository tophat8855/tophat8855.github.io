This was a very engaging book that made you want to keep reading, and I would have finished sooner if I 
wasn't besought by 20 other responsibilities at the moment. I know that the author tried to research thoroughly,
and that is mostly observable, except for one glaring cultural omission. No one in Kentucky would call lightning
bugs "fireflies." No one. Anywhere where lightning bugs exists in the US, they are called "lightning bugs" and 
are only called "fireflies" by people who have a romantic fascination with them because they don't live with them.
They're bugs. Their butts light up like lightning. That's it.

Anyway, despite that huge egregious error in culture, it was good. But man, that is really bothering me.
