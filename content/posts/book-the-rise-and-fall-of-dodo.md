I was going to give it 3, but it at least got linguistics and philology better than Seveneves, so I bumped it to 4. 
I listened via Hoopla and I think that was pretty golden. The audiobook is great for different voices, accents, and 
languages of the characters.

It's your usual time travel conundrums, but with witches, so that's fun. Stephenson tries to keep tabs on the timelines
and there are fun bits like the Trapezoid.
