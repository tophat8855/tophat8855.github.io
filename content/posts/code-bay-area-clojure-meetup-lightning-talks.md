On Tuesday, I attended the first hour of the Virtual Bay Area Clojure Meetup.
The meeting was recorded, but the video is not available yet.

There were two lightning talks: Ben Wen's _Using re-frame-firebase for fun and profit_, 
and Vincent Cantin's _Grammar-based CSS generation with Girouette_.

Wen shared a simple re-frame and firebase project to demonstarte how re-frame works.
His repo is [here](https://github.com/benzenwen/re-frame-firebase).
I've used re-frame a little bit in my day job, but mostly to test it out. After listening
to the talk, I think I'd like to try it a bit more in a personal project.

Cantin shared a new project he is working on, [Girouette](https://github.com/green-coder/girouette).
His goal is to create a CSS library that uses the Clojure-based library 
[Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) to generate CSS with a basic grammar. I had
never heard of Instaparse before so it'll be interesting to try it out myself.

I didn't get to hang around at the end and chat, but maybe I'll get a chance next time.
I'd like to give a lightning talk at one of these meetups in the future; need to find a topic.
