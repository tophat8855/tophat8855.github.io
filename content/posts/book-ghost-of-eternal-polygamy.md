This one took me months because I had the kindle version and then subsequently lost the Kindle. But I found it!

I think the most valuable aspect of the book is the stories/submissions to the survey that Pearson did. 
Reading the personal stories really brought home how much polygamy is still with the modern LDS church
and how it is harming families. It is something that is put in a shoebox and hidden in the back of the attic,
but it's still there... like the Jumanji board game... drumming in the background.

I could do with less JS veneration in my life, though.
