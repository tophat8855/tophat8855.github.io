This book felt like it took forever, mostly because I was supposed to read it in time for January We Bike Book Club
and it's been sitting on my shelf ever since.

This is a travelogue with a ton of food reviews and food descriptions in. Cloake is a food writer and she took a 
bike trip through France to try all the regional foods and rate croissants. I really liked the stories, but got tired
of descriptions of food. I might try a few of the recipes. I wanted to hear more stories of people, but most of the 
book is "I have a reservation here at ___ and I need to make it to the reservation, bike bike bike" followed by "This
is what I had and why it's so good." That's the whole book.
