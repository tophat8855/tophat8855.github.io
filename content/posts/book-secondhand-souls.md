Listened via Hoopla.

It's been some years since I read A Dirty Job, but I love the SF connections and the Emperor.
I like knowing where everything is taking place- like Grace Cathedral. Could use more (any) scenes
on BART though, like A Dirty Job had.

And as always Moore is just of irreverent jokes/references to sex/and just regular ridiculousness,
which is really fun. Great fluff to take your mind off the heavy things. Would recommend.
