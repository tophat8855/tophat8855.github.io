This review is also for [Baahubali 2: The Conclusion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/) because
I believe you can only watch these two together as a whole. The first sets up the second, but also could
be two separate movies in its own right: There is the current story and then the story from 50 years previously. 
The Conclusion fills in the gaps around 20/30 years ago. It is a fantastical myth-like story of the Baahubali family. 
When we first started watching it, I had no expectations.

Overall feelings: lots of action. AND DRAMA! It felt a little campy, but mostly dramatic in the most soap-opera-like way.
And that's fun. I love it when people walk into a room and drums start playing for them. Or pretty much any scene where
there is fire and wind blowing in people's faces so that their hair can be dramatic. That happened a lot. A lot a lot. 
It's long- it's 4 hours- but it's a DRAMATIC! 4 hours. 

They are careful to inform you that many of the animal scenes are CGI by posting a little water mark in the corner. But 
it's also just straight up easy to see that it's CGI. No one's hiding that fact, especially not the very obvious renders.
