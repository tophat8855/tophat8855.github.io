I think I liked this one better than the one about the women at the founding of the country. 
I learned a lot about the eponym of the city of Fremont to the south of where I currently live.
And frankly, a lot about a lot of the women of DC before and during the Civil War, which is the 
whole point of the book. So many parties and society nonsense. It feels very far from my own personal status
in the world, but it makes me assume something similar still happens out there among government people:i
parties and political conniving and rubbing of shoulders that I have nothing to do with as a regular citizen. 
Very fascinating look into history.
