It felt short, but I guess I'm a couple of decades older than the intended audience. Was a cute origin story, 
some of the story line/character development felt abrupt- I think that's due to how quickly it went through the story. 
The art was very eye-catching and very pretty. But if I was a pre-teen, this would probably be my jam.
