My oldest read it for school, so I figured I should read it before she has to return the book.

I was unsatisfied with Jerome telling Sarah that her dad made a mistake. Sure, he did, but you still 
have to be held accountable for your mistakes and he wasn't. And that goes for 99.99% of cops that have
ever shot anybody. And the dad helping Sarah with her website at the end? Pittance.

But it's probably a good book for the middle grades to be reading. It's at their level and teaches
some history and introduces important topics. Not that they need introducing. If you follow the news
children are shot by cops way too often (any cops shooting children is bad).
