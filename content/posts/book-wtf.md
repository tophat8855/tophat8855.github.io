I listened to the audio book via Hoopla. Gotta love 2.5 speed!

I'm trying to remember how this book ended up on my to-read list. I added it to my list
a few weeks after starting my new job, so maybe it was recommended by a coworker?
Or mentioned as a book club book for the office? I don't know.

I didn't find it as self-promoting as other reviewers did- maybe I'm used to this kind 
of talk? I do think he could have come down harder on Uber and Lyft. He gives pros/cons
to their business model, but despite how much he wants to talk about how technology can
be used to help the climate crisis, he totally ignores/never mentions the great increase 
of congestion and pollution in our cities and he seems to believe that ride sharing is
making our world safer and um... it's not. But I'll admit to be very biased against Uber's
company model. It's going to blow up in their faces.

But in general, if you are interested in the history of computer technology from the 80s 
forward to the Internet, this is pretty thorough.
