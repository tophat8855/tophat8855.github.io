I added this book to my to-read list after a friend of mine raved about it last year. She reads hundreds of books
a year and from her review, I decided to read this one. This review contains spoilers.

Beautifully written, worth it to read. The first section of the book with the portraits of the characters
was my favorite part. The language was consistently elaborate, so if you like that, you'll be cool with the whole
book. I do admire that Powers was consistent in his language, though- it's a long book. There's a lot of showing,
and less telling, of what is going on, so the reader has to fill in some of the blanks at times.

Other reviews mention that there were storylines/characters that could have been cut. I think most people mean
Neelay's story, but I rather liked it. It was a break from the main story that I think might not be relatable to
many readers- most people aren't eco-activists, but most people are gamers, even if it's just Words with Friend
s on their phone.

The story I think could have been cut was Ray Brinkman and Dorothy Cazaly's. I know some reviewers are saying
they think they are Olivia's parents, but I searched and didn't find evidence that a child ever existed. Yes, there's
that vision at the end of their daughter growing up alongside a chestnut tree, but I think that's more of wishful
"what our life could have been like if we had had a child." But maybe I'm wrong as that gives reason for even including
the whole Ray/Dorothy story line.

I think the most beneficial result of reading this book was reflecting on how trees have been important to me in my
life. When I signed up for 4H in 3rd grade, one of the subjects I signed up for was photography and I made sure to
photograph my favorite tree in front of my window, a Japanses Maple. When we moved to Illinois, there was a maple tree
in the strip of land between the sidwalk and the street that shaded the parking spot of the car I would end up using
most as a teen. Upon moving to college, I relished the fact that there was a large tree outside my 3rd floor dorm window.
And when I was in labor with my second child, I remember standing in the bath looking out the window to the trees outside
the apartment and talking to them about what I was feeling and going through. I was just grateful they were there.
I've always talked to trees and thought they listened.
