A good adaptation. The Orwell book I had to read for school was 1984, so I never got around 
to reading Animal Farm. Because my 12 year old read this, I decided to read it before it 
needed to be returned to the library.

I knew the basic story ahead of time he and when you pair it with the Wikipedia article on
Animal Farm, I think you get the whole idea. This adaptation directly quotes the original in
many places, though some details are left out, so you don’t get the satire about certain animals
such as the cat, or Mollie, or even the sheep.

But it’s a good introduction and you’ll get most of the references. The art is really nice, too.
Kudos to Odyr.
