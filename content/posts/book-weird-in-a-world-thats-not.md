This book falls in the "self-help book that's on my list just because reading a self-help book at random can create introspection" category.
Because I absolutely choose books at random off my to-read list.

My bias: I feel that the people who identify as "weird" are teenagers who haven't yet figured out that their experience is actually
pretty common and that feeling "weird" isn't actually a personality trait or something that makes you who you are. So when I pick up a
book that's directed at "weirdos" I kind of feel like the writer or audience hasn't actually gotten past their high school identifiers.

But the point of reading self-help books is to pick out what is helpful to you and ignore the rest, so here's the thing I got from this,
about 2 hours into the audio book: Use your "bad" feelings for your advantage. If you feel jealous about someone or something, 
maybe that actually means you'd like that and to modify your goals/5 year plan.

Also good tips for dealing with sexual harassment in the workplace, but that's not something on my radar right now because I'm at a good
place. But would be good for someone who is dealing with that, or for a young person who will probably. I know I dealt with that as early 
as 16 at my second job. So that part is good for your teens. Other parts are focused on being the manager/boss and therefore for people
later in their careers. So again, take what works for you now and leave the rest.
