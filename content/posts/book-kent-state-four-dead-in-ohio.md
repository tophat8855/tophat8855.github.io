I've read Backderf's other graphic novels and decided to try this one out. I didn't know a lot about
the Kent State massacre/shooting, and as it just hit its 50 anniversary last year, I bet most people
are in the same boat as I am, and those that do remember it probably remember it very differently than
how it actually went down because of how the event was spun.

If you want a thorough overview of the events leading up to and after the Kent State shooting, 
this is a good place to start. The notes at the back are where you learn the most, and you have to 
get through the notes to get to the damning epilogue. Worth a read.
