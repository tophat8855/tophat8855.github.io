I read Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood a couple of years ago and it didn't leave a
huge impression on me so I'm not upset about learning negative things about the characters
in this one- that's how people are. Even people you think are great can be abusers. 
It's how they get away with the abuse.

It's good if you want to read about intergenerational relationships of southern white
women in the second half of the 20th century. I know this book started as a short story
and I'm curious what event in the book that short story was based on. I think the book is
generally realistic in how alcoholism affects families.

I listened to the audiobook via Hoopla
