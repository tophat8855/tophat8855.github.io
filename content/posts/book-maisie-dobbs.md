One of my book clubs had designated this book for August 2012, but I missed reading and participating that year. 
I am only 8 years late to it. It's both a period read and a mystery, with a couple of mysteries in it. I listened 
to it via Hoopla.

The first part of the story sounded very familiar. Either it’s a common trope to follow a woman to a mysterious
grave when you’re a PI or I had heard that section as an audio book while riding in a Casual Carpool Ride.

I know this is a whole series and will add the next one to my list. I think we’re all feeling nostalgic
for a time when they had all gotten past a pandemic and major war. That's the life we all want.
