I found I really liked the short stories/fairy tales that are included in the
book as examples of the historic character's writings. I bet that Byatt wanted to
write Victorian poetry and fairytales and then decided to put them into a more modern
novel because they might otherwise be overlooked. And hey, you do what you need to do
to write what you want to write! I'm a big fan of the seance scenes and ideas. 
Almost makes me want to have a seance.
