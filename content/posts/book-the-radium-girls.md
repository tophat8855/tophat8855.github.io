I listened to the audiobook on Hoopla.

This story is really important and it's great that these women are having their 
stories told after being gaslit by scientists, doctors, and mainly their employer. 
They suffered so much and so much of what we know about radiation poisoning and what
we do for worker's rights is due to their illness and deaths. The book follows the
chronological narrative arc and it's LONG, but really important stuff.
