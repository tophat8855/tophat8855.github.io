3.5 stars. It's not peak literature, but hey, if you want a fluffy murder mystery tangentially related 
to knitting that takes place around the holidays to keep your mind off the the real world, this is your book!

I really liked it for what it is. This isn't my first Seaside Knitters Society Mystery book, but I'm not 
reading them in order. Just listening to whatever is available on Hoopla. :)
