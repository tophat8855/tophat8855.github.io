This book tells the story of Lou and Toby Maytree, who marry each other in their youth and love each other and have a child,
but end up apart while Toby marries Lou's friend. In the end, Lou takes care of Toby and his second wife as they age and die.
It is about people who were together drifting apart, and then coming back together. 

I listened to the audio book via Hoopla. It's a steady without an overall problem to solve except that life keeps going
and we're all going to die, and what is love and what is life, what is aging, etc. Memento mori, my friends. I feel like 
coming off the heels of another similar book- about life and how it goes along- I must be in that space. I know I'm almos
t rarely in the space to think about death, but it's kind of raw right now. A reminder that books are there to remind you 
of your mortality.
