Started strong, slow in parts, end was an exciting rush.

For a book about a female protagonist, it doesn't pass the Bechdel test- which kind of tells
you Sanderson doesn't know how to write women. Vin is more well written than the protagonist 
woman in [Elantris](/book-elantris) (who is TALL and NOT LIKE THE OTHER WOMEN), but if that's the only woman he
can write in a book that is hundreds of pages long, he doesn't know how to write women. He's not the only fantasy
writer who struggles with this, but it is the 21st century.

But the magic is interesting. I'll give the next book a try.
