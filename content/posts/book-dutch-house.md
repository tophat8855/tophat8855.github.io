This book was for the RS book club this past month, but I did not finish it in time to participate. In fact, I haven't participated since SIP, but I
suppose that is neither here nor there. 

I was a pretty easy read- I didn't find myself wanting to skip or skim anything. It took me a little while to figure out that the narrator was a boy- I thought it was about 2 sisters.

I think the men in the story, both the narrator and his father, have really no clue about their wives. Clearly they demonstrate that they don't understand what their wives want/desire. Maybe that was the times. The narrator had a lot of things happen to him, but he was rarely the initiator of anything. 

I think the relationships between everyone were very real. It's easy to see how everything fell about and how the grudges were held and it doesn't seem like it could have been any other way. The relationships between the characters was really what shone in this story and it never felt like it was a slog- the pace and length were both very good.
