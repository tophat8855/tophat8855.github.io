I expected this book to be harder to get through because of the topic of grief- 
and there were some very intense stories, but they aren't all like that. 
Some content warnings for death of children, spouse, crashes, illness, etc.
It's about grief.

I liked Elly Blue's story, the one about the kidnapped sister, and the fiction story best.

But I liked the short story/memoir format and I got through the book at a nice pace.
Was definitely what I needed to read right now. Remember you're mortal. 
Enjoy the ride. Momento mori.
