This was very sweet and the art was lovely. It would be perfect for a young teen to read
I'll recommend it to my own. I did find the ending rushed, after the nice pacing up until
about 3/4 of the way in. But I guess that's how it goes. I'd read its sequel. The world
was very interesting- how ghosts can come over to the world of the living, but shouldn't
according to their own laws, and how memory works, etc. At times I felt sympathy for the
antagonist, but in the end, he's a real jerk.
