Hoo boy, this didn't age well, huh? Those Louis CK parts and the racial slurs. I know Silverman's brand is to be
raunchy and non-PC, so sure. But still. I liked the childhood stories and her stick-to-it-iveness. All admirable. 
But you can get through life just fine without reading this book. I don't know why it was on my list to start with.
Someone must have recommended it and I don't remember who. :shrug:
