I listened to the graphic audio version since it was short and I had just finished Elantris.
It is probably better to read it. Sometime when voice actors do Children’s voices, 
they make them too saccharine and that’s what happened here. It seemed almost silly. 
So probably better to read on paper. It doesn’t add much to the story other than to fill
in what a few extra characters were doing during the apex of the Elantra’s plot.
