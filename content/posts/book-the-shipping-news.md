This was a lovely read, or listen since I listened via Hoopla. The story good along quickly and itâ€™s a 
vignette of Newfoundland and it made me want to live where it is truly chilly again. I found the writing to
be nice as an audio book, but did have to go back and re-listen at one point because my mind wandered too much
and I lost track of the story- it gets going in the second half of the book.
