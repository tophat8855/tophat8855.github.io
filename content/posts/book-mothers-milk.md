I should have read this 3 years ago, but I bought it so that I could give it as a gift and wanted to read it before I passed it along.
And now I think I'll have to buy 2 more as gifts*.

The poems are very short and some are saccharine, but the small bits are nice if you are looking for something to mentally chew on for
a little bit between other busy parts of your life. Not all are homeruns, but enough nougats are in there that I chuckled and smiled at
occasional nodes to what would be Mormon inside-jokes or references.

Definitely very Mormon- many Mormon references- but would be good for any Christian or Christian-adjacent spiritual person looking for 
more Mother Goddess/Feminine Divine in their life. Lots of poems about birth and breastfeeding, and a couple of nods to the fact that 
not all women are mothers, but if you're struggling with birth/breastfeeding imagery, then probably not for you. 

*Reader, I did indeed buy two more.
