I liked this one enough that I believe I'll buy it.. The first half is bicycle maintenance 
and it seems like a good reference with nice illustrations. I’d love to take a bicycle apart 
and put it back together for a tune up as described in the book.

The second half is photocopies of the Chainbreaker zine, which is just lovely to read and a treat 
to look at. It’s the sort of book that, if left around the house, I would have picked up as a teen 
to read while eating breakfast or whatever. And I’d like to have it around for my own kids to 
pick up and read. It is worth at least opening up and looking at it if you come across it. You’ll want to look at more.
