I listened to this interview with Naomi Shihab Nye from [On Being](https://onbeing.org/programs/naomi-shihab-nye-before-you-know-kindness-as-the-deepest-thing-inside/) 
and decided to start reading poetry to my teenage as a way to wake her up in the morning, so I started with this book. A poem every day (almost).

It's a great collection and definitely a good level for my teenager. I think it would have benefited her to
read them on the page herself, but aloud is ok too.

She constantly fought to keep me from reading every morning, but when I started reading, she always got quiet
and listened. Recently, she didn't want me to read her a poem so I told her to read one to me and she actually 
went and found a (different) poetry book and read a poem to me, so I think that's positive.

I'll get another Naomi Shihab Nye book for her in the future. I think we'll mix things up and do Emily Dickinson next.
