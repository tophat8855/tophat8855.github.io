Every so often in the circles I travel online, someone mentions Sanderson so I decided to add him to my to-read list.

While reading this, I realized I haven't read fantasy in a really long time- science fiction, yes, but not fantasy.
I read lots of fantasy as an early teen and loved it a lot and it was nice to be reminded how much I like fantasy.
I also really liked the political intrigue aspects as well. Elantris is his first book so I'm guessing (hoping) he
gets better at writing characters that are not caricatures. Like we know Raoden is our Mary Sue and our female protagonis
t Sarene is FEMINIST and TALL and all the other women are demure and don't think for themselves.

Also, it's obvious at places that Sanderson is Mormon and he takes some phrases/ideas straight out of the BoM. Those are
Easter Eggs you're going to have to find for yourself.

But a promising book. I'll try the Mistborn book next.
