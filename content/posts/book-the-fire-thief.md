A friend passed this book on to me for my kids and I got my 13 year old to read it so I figured I 
should read it too. It's ok. My kid liked the conversation tone and the asides- they thought they 
were clever and funny. I thought they were a little overdone. And the Uncle Edward character is 
not redeemable at all, I don't know why they went through all that work to save him. If it ended
with Uncle Edward dying, I would not have been upset. And it's a bit forced, but hey, it's a short
middle school-aged fantasy book, so that's what you get.
