I read this for RS book group March 2021. I finished it later than the book group and didn't
attend to it because it was scheduled on the same date as the Bay Area Clojure Meet up and I was
Zoomed-out. 

It took me a little to get into the book. The framing of the woman going with her children to see 
a place from her childhood and then the story going to her childhood- just didn't grip my attention.
It was a boring way to start the book. I did like the first chapter better, though, after reading the book. 
I went back to re-read it. It probably should have been put further in the back.

I think the book captures childhood well-how events feel so big but looking back they are small, and how
your child perspective is so different from the adults around you. I can see why it was a popular book for 
teaching in schools, but I also see that it's not as relevant to children these days, or more accurately,
other books are more relevant than this one. But it's a nice story and could make a good read-aloud, as it's short.
