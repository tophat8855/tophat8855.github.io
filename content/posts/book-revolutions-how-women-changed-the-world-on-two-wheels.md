Whew! It took me a while to get through this book because it got lost in the house for over a month and the library kept renewing it.
I did eventually finish, though!

The beginning was bumpy for me. This is a nonfiction collection of stories of women on bicycles and it's organized in a couple of ways: 
thematically and chronologically. And within the themed chapters, organized somewhat chronologically, 
there are lots of stories and it felt disconnected. But I got used to it and fell into the swing of things in the last 2/3 or so.

I knew some of the stories already, having read Dervla Murphy's travelogue/memoir, and the biography on Annie Londonderry. 
I was unsure about reading the last couple of chapters, which focus mostly on racing as I'm mostly a bicyclist who bikes to get places and not to race. 
But I've been convinced to try cyclocross.
