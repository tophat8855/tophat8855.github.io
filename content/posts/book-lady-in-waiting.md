I feel bad giving this 2 stars, but I'm not really into the lives of British royalty and gentry. I read this for
the RS book club last month, but hadn't finished it in time. It definitely reads like someone telling the stories
of their life, but there's not a whole lot of reflection. Lots of "and then we had this party and ate these and 
these people wore this stuff." It wasn't until Glenconner started experiencing grief with her sons that I really 
enjoyed it.  And that's all in the last third of the book. The little stories about Princess Margaret and other
royal/titled people are interesting, but not really. I haven't watched The Crown- maybe I would enjoy it more? Meh.
I bet if you're into the royal family and stories like that, you may like this. Glenconner seems like she's enjoying 
her retirement and that's great.

I also don't think the title fits the book. I don't know if I felt the aspects of "in the Shadow of the Crown" when I read it.
