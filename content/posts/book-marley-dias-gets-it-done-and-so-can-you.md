 I read this one because my 7th grader is also reading it for school. It's less about her #1000blackgirlbooks campaign 
 (though it is a little about it) and more about how preteens/teens can advocate and do activism.
 It's pretty simplified, but I think that's for the audience. Would recommend to pre-teens/young teens. 
 
 You can tell that it was either heavily edited or ghostwritten by an adult. At times they try too much to sound like
 how adults think teens sound like. Also a little dated refernces (eg. malls).
