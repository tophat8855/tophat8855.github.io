This book is Pat fictionalized memoir and part non-fiction information about 
where our garbage goes and exactly how much waste we all create. Good reminder 
that all the packaging we get on our food and products is the largest contributor 
to our trash content. Want to learn about the history of landfills and Hours little 
recycling really does? Also brought me back to when I was looking for blue collar 
jobs and what was available. I have a cushy white collar job now, but you should
never think yourself too good for a blue collar job. They are WORK.

This is the first Iâ€™ve read from Backderf, I will probably read miss from him.
