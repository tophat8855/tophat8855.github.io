This was a very good book- it is easy to read and I think a lot of the fiction, and even nonfiction,
that I've read this year had lots of flowery language and were beautiful, but this is just great to read.
It's easy on your mind, while also dealing with heavy issues. I audibly gasped (and frightened my husband) at parts.
I'd definitely recommend a read for older teens and adults.
