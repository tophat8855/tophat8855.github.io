Listened to the audiobook via Hoopla.

So very pertinent to our current times, despite being 80 years old, as all good
literature should be. The voices of the different characters are distinct and clear 
and McCullers does a great job of giving the reader an understanding of the time and place.
Definitely a good read if you are looking for a good American novel.
