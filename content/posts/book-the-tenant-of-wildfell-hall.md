I listened to this through the CraftLit podcast, which I absolutely love.

I hadn't read anything by Anne Brontë before, but I did enjoy it. The ending is a 
lot more mild compared to her sisters' books. But it's a great example of "good guys" 
and how to spot abuse and other bad behavior. Even the man who wins the girl in the 
end has some problematic toxic masculinity.
