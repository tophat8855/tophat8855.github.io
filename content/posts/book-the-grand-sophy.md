Good if you need something light and quick. I think Sophy is a bit of a Mary Sue,
but I guess that's how romance novels go. You just accept these things going in,
like cousins marrying cousins. And ignore the racist depiction of the money lender.

But do you need fluff to hide away from the mess of your life? 
This book has stood the test of time.
