A lot has happened in those 8 years and the whole last\\nseason was colored by Charisma Carpenter's startements of how terrible Whedon is. Veronica Mars. We watched Angel\\nconcurrently with Buffy so that we could watch where the crossovers happen. I absolutely believe Carpenter and I wish\\nthere was something I could enjoy without knowing that slimy people were behind it. I wish Gellar had more gumption about\\nmaking statements like Carpenter does, but I also understand if she wants a break from that mess. It's easy to get typecast.\\nAs with everyone else, \\\"Once More With Feeling,\\\" was a lot of fun. I think if you want to watch a show that takes place in SoCal\\nwith a blonde, early college-aged woman tackling issues like sexual assault in the early 2000s, you'll do better to watch\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"id":"f69a81c8-2f05-5885-880a-0dc4bb145311"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1961101537","2542493696"]}
