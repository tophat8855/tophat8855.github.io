# Coding Projects

If you are interested in my current work, check out my [github profile](https://github.com/tophat8855), but here are a few highlights
since I know there are a lot of throwaway, practice, and tutorial repos in my github.

I currently work for [Centripetal Networks](https://www.centripetal.ai/), as a senior Clojure engineer.

I previously worked for [Mayvenn](https://shop.mayvenn.com), coding primarily in Clojure and ClojureScript. 
The [storefront](https://github.com/Mayvenn/storefront) is publically available to read as an example of using ClojureScript for a production site.

Even earlier, I worked at [Pivotal](https://tanzu.vmware.com/) and was on [Cloud Foundry's](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) Release Integration team 
right as they were moving from [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/cf-release) to [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).
I also worked a bunch on their [runtime-ci](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/runtime-ci).

I worked on internal projects at Pivotal, so I can't link to much, but I contributed to a couple of other libraries, such as 
[Chemtrails](https://github.com/pivotal-legacy/chemtrails).

In March 2017, I participated in an [Abortion Access Hackathon](https://www.abortionaccesshackathon.com/sanfranciscoabortionaccesshackathon) and worked
on a team building the [TEACH Program's](https://www.teachtraining.org/) tracking app. The app was used for medical residents to track which medical 
procedures they observed and participated in during their residencies. Prior to this app, they were using spreadsheets, which made for extra work for the
residents, doctors, and the people working on compiling the data for reports and grants.

I completed [Galvanize's](https://www.galvanize.com/) Full Stack program and did a few projects while learning. My final project was an app 
called [Carfree](https://carfree.herokuapp.com/) and used BART, AC Transit, and Google Maps location data to track distances a person travels
and determine how many pounds of CO2 was saved on each of those trips. [Backend Code](https://github.com/tophat8855/gProject-API)
[Frontend Code](https://github.com/tophat8855/gProject-frontend/).

I also did a few fun projects while I was learning. My favorite is this [MASH game](https://github.com/tophat8855/one-page-mash),
which I used to practice jQuery. [You can play it](https://tophat8855.github.io/one-page-mash/).

And as always, the classic [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/tophat8855/conways-game-of-life).
